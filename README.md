# Project Site Starter

This is a dead-simple project website starter template powered by Rust (the [Perseus framework](https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US) in particular), complete with a project blog and feedback form! Handily, you don't need to know Rust to use this though, you get all its performance benefits for free, and you can write your entire site in Markdown! But, because it's a template repo, you can dig into the underlying code whenever you like!
